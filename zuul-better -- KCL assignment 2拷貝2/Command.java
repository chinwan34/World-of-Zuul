/**
 * This class is part of the "A stereotypical maze adventure" application.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command consists of two or three strings: a command word, a second
 * word, and an optional third word.
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word and the third word is null.
