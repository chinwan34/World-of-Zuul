This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has in total of 10 rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
Furthermore, it has items stored in different rooms where the players can interact with it, 
and NPCs that travels between different rooms randomly. There is also some special characters, 
including the riddler and the boss.

The goal of this game is to defeat the final boss who locates in the "boss room", the player has
to gather weapons and fight NPCs to get rewards, also interact with the riddler in order to fight the
boss and defeat him. 

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This project was written as the starting point of a small Java project.

The goal is to extend the game:

  - add items to rooms (items may have weight)
  - add multiple players
  - add commands (pick, drop, examine, read, ...)
  - (anything you can think of, really...)

Read chapter 8 of the book to get a detailed description of the project.
